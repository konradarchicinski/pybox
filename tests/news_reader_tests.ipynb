The 30-second spot uses older remarks from Fauci in a way that suggests he was praising the president.\n“I can’t imagine that anybody could be doing more,” the ad shows Fauci saying.\nBut those remarks are from a March interview, where Fauci, who has been director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) since 1984, was discussing the broader effort, including by the White House coronavirus task force.\n“In my nearly five decades of public service, I have never publicly endorsed any political candidate,” Fauci said in a statement.\n“The comments attributed to me without my permission in the GOP campaign ad were taken out of context from a broad statement I made months ago about the efforts of federal public health officials,” his statement added.\nTrump campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh defended the ad in a statement on Sunday, saying the words from Fauci “are accurate, and directly from Dr. Fauci’s mouth.\n“As Dr. Fauci recently testified in the Senate, President Trump took the virus seriously from the beginning, acted quickly, and saved lives,” Murtaugh’s statement added.\nTrump himself echoed that sentiment in a tweet on Sunday, saying: “They are indeed Dr. Fauci’s own words. We have done a ‘phenomenal’ job, according to certain governors.”\nFauci and Trump have not always agreed on how to handle the pandemic, which has infected nearly 7.7 million people in the United States and killed more than 214,000. Opinion polls show most voters disapprove of the president’s handling of the crisis.\nOn Friday, Fauci described a Sept. 26 White House event, after which several attendees including Trump, tested positive for the virus, as a “superspreader event.”\nABC News said on Sunday it had asked the White House to allow Fauci to appear on “The Week,” but the administration refused to make him or other members of the task force available.\nAlyssa Farah, the White House communications director, said later on Twitter that Fauci had made other media appearances earlier in the week, rebutting the charge he was “muzzled.”</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>2020-10-12 00:31:00</td>\n<td>EMERGING MARKETS</td>\n<td>Turkey to conduct seismic survey in eastern Mediterranean</td>\n<td>https://www.reuters.com/article/us-turkey-greece/turkey-to-conduct-seismic-survey-in-eastern-mediterranean-idUSKBN26W0YR</td>\n<td>ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey’s navy has issued an advisory late Sunday saying that the Turkish ship Oruc Reis will carry out a seismic survey in the eastern Mediterranean over the next ten days, a step likely to revive tensions with NATO ally Greece.\nTwo other vessels, the Ataman and Cengiz Han along with Oruc Reis exploration ship will continue works in an area including the south of Greek island of Kastellorizo until Oct. 22, the maritime notice said.\nThe two countries are at odds over overlapping claims for hydrocarbon resources in the region. The foreign ministers of Turkey and Greece met last week and agreed to hold bilateral talks on the disputes.\nLast month, Ankara withdrew Oruc Reis from contested waters to “allow for diplomacy” ahead of a European Union summit.\nAfter the summit the bloc said it would punish Turkey if it continued its operations in the region, in a move Ankara said further strained Turkey-EU ties.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2020-10-11 18:29:00</td>\n<td>U.S. MARKETS</td>\n<td>White House seeks limited coronavirus relief bill, promises further talks on broader stimulus</td>\n<td>https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-congress-relief/white-house-seeks-limited-coronavirus-relief-bill-promises-further-talks-on-broader-stimulus-idUSKBN26W0QO</td>\n<td>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration on Sunday called on Congress to pass a stripped-down coronavirus relief bill using leftover funds from an expired small business loan program as negotiations on a broader package ran into resistance.\nThe proposal was the latest twist in the on-again, off-again talks to try to secure more stimulus for the economy, which is struggling to recover from coronavirus-related shutdowns that threw millions of Americans out of work.\nIn a letter to lawmakers, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and White House Chief of State Mark Meadows said they would continue to talk to Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to try to reach agreement on a comprehensive bill.\nHowever, they said Congress should “immediately vote” on legislation to enable the use of the unused Paycheck Protection Program funds, which total around $130 billion.\n“The all or nothing approach is an unacceptable response to the American people,” they wrote.\nA spokesman for Pelosi, the lead negotiator for Democrats, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nWhite House spokesman Brian Morgenstern told reporters the funds would be used to reopen the Payroll Protection Program, which expired earlier this year, to “allow businesses to continue to use it to keep their employees employed.”\nPresident Donald Trump on Friday offered a $1.8 trillion coronavirus relief package in talks with Pelosi after urging his team on Twitter to “go big” - moving closer to Pelosi’s $2.2 trillion proposal. That came after Trump earlier last week said he was calling off negotiations until after the Nov. 3 election.\nTrump’s reversal and higher offer drew criticism from several Senate Republicans, many of whom are uneasy about the nation’s growing debt and concerned a deal would cost Republicans support in the upcoming election.\nFederal Reserve officials have urged Congress to be aggressive in supporting the U.S. economy. The head of the Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank on Sunday said the recovery had “flattened out” indicating the need for further stimulus.\n“A lot of people are suffering. A lot of small businesses are suffering,” Minneapolis Fed chief Neel Kashkari said on CBS’ “Face the Nation.” “We need Congress to continue to be aggressive so that the recovery can be stronger.”\nWhite House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said on CNN’s “State of the Union” that he thought Senate Republicans would eventually come around.\n“I think if an agreement can be reached, they will go along with it,” he said, adding that there will be “further efforts of negotiation” on a package this week.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2020-10-11 23:45:00</td>\n<td>BUSINESS NEWS</td>\n<td>EU planning tougher regulation for 'hit list' of big tech firms: FT</td>\n<td>https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-tech/eu-planning-tougher-regulation-for-hit-list-of-big-tech-firms-ft-idUSKBN26W0XV</td>\n<td>(Reuters) - European Union regulators are making a 'hit list' of up to 20 large internet companies, potentially including Facebook FB.O, Apple AAPL.O, Amazon AMZN.O and Alphabet's GOOGL.O Google, that will be facing new and tougher rules aimed at curbing their market power, the Financial Times reported on.ft.com/34NZ3lW.\nThe big technology platforms will have to comply with tougher regulation than smaller competitors, the newspaper reported on Sunday, citing people familiar with the discussions.\nNew rules will force the companies to share data with rivals and be more transparent on how they gather information, the report said.\nThe list will be made based on parameters like market share and number of users, the newspaper said, adding that the exact number of companies and the precise criteria for the list was still being discussed.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>2020-10-11 22:17:00</td>\n<td>WORLD NEWS</td>\n<td>At least 11 die as migrant boat sinks off Tunisia</td>\n<td>https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tunisia-migrants/at-least-11-die-as-migrant-boat-sinks-off-tunisia-idUSKBN26W0WG</td>\n<td>TUNIS (Reuters) - At least 11 migrants from Africa died when their boat sank off Tunisia on Sunday, as they tried to cross the Mediterranean to the Italian island of Lampedusa, a Tunisian security official said.\nTunisia’s coast guard recovered the bodies of eight women and three children off the coast near Sfax late on Sunday, he said.\nAbout 30 people had set out on the boat, aiming to reach Italy, officials said.\nThe coast guard is searching for the other missing people.\nLast year, about 90 African migrants drowned after their boat capsized enroute to Europe from Libya, one of the worst such accidents in Tunisian waters.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>...</td>\n<td>...</td>\n<td>...</td>\n<td>...</td>\n<td>...</td>\n<td>...</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>2020-10-11 21:01:00</td>\n<td>WORLD NEWS</td>\n<td>Factbox: New Zealand parties clash over COVID-19, economy, taxes and housing</td>\n<td>https://www.reuters.com/article/us-newzealand-election-policy-factbox/factbox-new-zealand-parties-clash-over-covid-19-economy-taxes-and-housing-idUSKBN26W0V1</td>\n<td>(Reuters) - New Zealand holds a general election on Oct. 17, with Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern’s centre-left Labour Party holding a wide lead over the centre-right main opposition National Party.\nBelow are the main issues in the election.\nArdern has called this a “COVID election” and focussed her campaign on her government’s “go hard, go early” response to the outbreak, which has helped boost her popularity and make her an international celebrity.\nNew Zealand has reported 25 deaths from COVID-19 and around 1,500 infections after Ardern’s swift response, far less than in other developed countries. That’s about 0.05 death per 10,000 people, compared to the United States at 6.49 or India at 0.78, according to Reuters calculations.\nNew Zealand placed the most significant restrictions on public movements in modern history in the initial phase of the coronavirus outbreak by closing its borders, imposing self-isolation and shutting down most of its economy to contain the spread of the virus.\nLabour says it would continue tight controls and quarantines and would strengthen the contact-tracing system.\nNational says it would establish a border protection agency within 100 days of forming a government to prevent future outbreaks. It blames Labour’s border rules for allowing a recent flare-up in the country’s largest city, Auckland.\nArdern has said climate change is “my generation’s nuclear-free moment”. Labour vows to phase out single-use plastics and replace coal-fired boilers with electric alternatives, and says it would end the use of carbon by public buses by 2035.\nIt aims to create 11,000 jobs in regional New Zealand to restore the environment, including cleaning up waterways to allow safe swimming.\nArdern says she would accelerate New Zealand’s target of 100% renewable electricity generation by five years to 2030, responding to criticism from opposition leader Judith “Crusher” Collins.\nCollins, leader of the National Party, says Ardern’s policies would raise electricity bills 40% and cost thousands of jobs.\nClimate change, a key issue in the election, has pitted the parties against each other on policies on oil and gas exploration - National wants to lift a ban on exploration and seeks “responsible mining”.\nThe government, in which Labour is joined by the smaller New Zealand First party, announced in May a record NZ$50 billion ($30 billion) in spending to revive the pandemic-hit economy, saying it would help businesses hire at least 40,000 who had lost their jobs or seen their working hours reduced.\nLabour promises to extend a loan scheme for small firms and invest more than NZ$300 million to help the unemployed find jobs.\nNational says it would provide companies NZ$10,000 for each new employee hired and pay higher-education and vocational training centres NZ$4,000 for every unemployed person they retrained.\nArdern vows to raise individual income taxes on the top-earning 2% and plug loopholes for big foreign companies. No changes have been proposed for tax rates of companies and trusts but the individuals making over NZ$180,000 annually would pay 39%, up from 33%.\nNational promises short-term tax cuts worth about NZ$4.7 billion to revive the economy. The party says its temporary tax relief would put more than NZ$3,000 – nearly NZ$50 a week – into the pockets of average earners over the next 16 months.\nCollins promises NZ$430 million in one-year tax incentives for businesses that invest more than NZ$150,000 on new equipment and machinery.\nLabour wants to invest NZ$600 million to raise wages of early childhood teachers and to boost funding for the most disadvantaged schools by NZ$320 million over the next four years.\nNational would spend NZ$4.8 billion to build schools and colleges. It proposes a four-year NZ$1.9 billion package focussing on learning support and teacher aides.\nLabour promises to double sick leave to 10 days a year with an additional NZ$200 million to be spent over four years to cut waiting lists for surgeries. An aged-care commissioner would be established as a watchdog over the sector.\nNational would spend NZ$800 million more on the health sector during its term and promises faster elective surgeries and more money for cancer treatments.\nArdern says her government would create a NZ$350 million fund for residential housing plans and reform decades-old laws in the sector to speed up approvals.\nShe promises to deliver more homes, replace a 30-year-old law that limited cost increases for urban development, support first-home buyers with loans and introduce regulations for property-management services.\nCollins promises to scrap that law which is blamed for high housing costs. She dismisses Ardern’s housing plans as copying National’s.\nCollins vows to pass emergency laws - similar to those used to rebuild the city of Christchurch after a 2011 earthquake - to build homes and curb rising home prices.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>2020-10-11 19:48:00</td>\n<td>2020 U.S. ELECTIONS</td>\n<td>Democrat Harrison smashes Senate fundraising record with $57 million haul in South Carolina</td>\n<td>https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-senate/democrat-harrison-smashes-senate-fundraising-record-with-57-million-haul-in-south-carolina-idUSKBN26W0SY</td>\n<td>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrat Jaime Harrison of South Carolina raised a stunning $57 million in the third quarter of 2020 in his bid to unseat U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham, his campaign said on Sunday, smashing the quarterly record for a Senate candidate.\nThe fundraising haul by Harrison, a former chairman of the state party, blew past the previous quarterly record of $38.1 million set by former Democratic Representative Beto O’Rourke during his unsuccessful 2018 U.S. Senate bid in Texas.\nIt also is likely to increase Harrison’s financial advantage over Graham, who was once considered a sure bet to be elected to a fourth term in the U.S. Senate but is now facing a desperate fight for political survival.\nRecent polls have shown a tight race between Harrison and Graham, who ran against President Donald Trump in the 2016 White House Republican primary but is now one of his closest allies in Congress. Trump won South Carolina by 14 percentage points in 2016.\nThe South Carolina seat could be pivotal in the battle for control of the Senate. If Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden wins the White House, Democrats need to pick up a net three seats in the Nov. 3 election to gain control of the Senate.\nGraham has not reported his third-quarter fundraising yet. He raised $8.4 million in the second quarter and has openly pleaded with supporters to help with donations. He told Fox News recently he was “getting overwhelmed” financially.\nHarrison’s fundraising haul was driven by contributions from 994,000 donors, his campaign said. He has now raised $86 million in the cycle.\nThe Graham campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16</td>\n<td>2020-10-11 13:04:00</td>\n<td>AMERS</td>\n<td>Supreme Court nominee Barrett pledges fealty to law as Senate hearing looms</td>\n<td>https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-barrett-preview/supreme-court-nominee-barrett-pledges-fealty-to-law-as-senate-hearing-looms-idUSKBN26W0GM</td>\n<td>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett will tell senators in her high-stakes confirmation hearing this week that she will approach cases based on the law, not her personal views, as Democrats urged her to step aside on an upcoming challenge to the Obamacare law and any potential election-related disputes.\nA four-day Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation hearing for the conservative appellate court judge is set to begin on Monday, a key step before a final full Senate vote by the end of October on her nomination for a lifetime job on the court.\nIn a copy of her prepared remarks released on Sunday, Barrett said that as a judge she seeks to “reach the result required by the law, whatever my own preferences might be.”\nBarrett, 48, said in the statement that it will be an “honor of a lifetime” to serve alongside the current eight justices and explained how she approaches cases.\n“When I write an opinion resolving a case, I read every word from the perspective of the losing party. I ask myself how would I view the decision if one of my children was the party I was ruling against,” she wrote.\nBarrett’s confirmation to replace the late liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg would create a 6-3 conservative majority on the court that could lead to rulings rolling back abortion rights, expanding religious and gun rights, and upholding Republican-backed voting restrictions, among other issues.\nDemocratic opposition to Barrett on policy issues has focused on her possible role in deciding a case before the Supreme Court in which Trump and Republican-led states are seeking to invalidate the Affordable Care Act (ACA) healthcare law, often called Obamacare.\nSenate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said on Sunday that Barrett should, if confirmed, step aside from the case, which is scheduled to be argued at the court on Nov. 10.\n“She doesn’t come unbiased and that’s why she should recuse herself,” he said.\nA key Obamacare provision that would be thrown out if the court strikes down the law bars insurance companies from denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions. Democrats have criticized Trump for seeking to end Obamacare protections amid a pandemic that has killed more than 210,000 Americans.\nSchumer also said Barrett should recuse herself from any cases involving the presidential election because of statements made by Trump in which the president has said the court is likely to have election cases. Trump, who is running for reelection against Democrat Joe Biden, has indicated he would expect the court to rule in his favor if Barrett is confirmed.\nUnder existing rules, individual justices have the final say on whether they should recuse.\nThe Senate’s Republican leaders rejected Democratic pleas to delay the hearing after two Republican Judiciary Committee members and Trump himself tested positive for the coronavirus in the days following his Sept. 26 White House ceremony announcing Barrett as his nominee.\nBarrett, who will appear in person, is scheduled to deliver her opening statement to the committee on Monday, with senators also making opening remarks. Each senator has the final call on whether to attend in person. Democratic Senator Kamala Harris, Biden’s running mate, will participate remotely because of the health concerns, a spokesman said on Sunday.\nBarrett is set to face questions from senators on Tuesday and Wednesday, starting with Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, for what promises to be grueling all-day sessions. The hearing is due to conclude on Thursday with outside witnesses testifying about her qualifications.\nWith Republicans holding a 53-47 Senate majority, Barrett’s confirmation seems assured. Democrats are still fuming that McConnell is hurrying to confirm Barrett as the election approaches, after blocking consideration of Democratic President Barack Obama’s nominee to fill a 2016 Supreme Court vacancy during an election year.\nGraham has said his committee will likely vote on the nomination on Oct. 22, setting up a vote on the Senate floor by the end of the month.\n“We can easily get her confirmed before the election,” he said on Sunday in an appearance on Fox News show “Sunday Morning Futures.”\nBarrett also is expected to face Democratic questioning on abortion. In 2006, while teaching law at the University of Notre Dame, Barrett, a devout Catholic, added her name to an advertisement opposing “abortion on demand” that appeared in a local newspaper in Indiana and also signed a similar statement in 2013, she disclosed on Friday.\nChristian conservative activists long have hoped for the court to overturn the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized abortion nationwide.\nDuring her 2017 confirmation hearing to her current judgeship, Barrett said her religious faith would not affect her decisions on the bench.\nRepublicans have said questions about Barrett’s religious faith should be off-limits and so far Democrats have indicated they will not focus on it. Democratic Senator Mazie Hirono said in an interview on CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday that Barrett’s religious views were “irrelevant.”</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17</td>\n<td>2020-10-11 20:02:00</td>\n<td>TECHNOLOGY NEWS</td>\n<td>Twitter flags Trump tweet for violating its rules on COVID-19 information</td>\n<td>https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-trump-twitter/twitter-flags-trump-tweet-for-violating-its-rules-on-covid-19-information-idUSKBN26W0TI</td>\n<td>(Reuters) - Twitter on Sunday flagged a tweet by Donald Trump in which the U.S. President claimed he was immune to the coronavirus, saying it violated the social media platform’s rules about misleading information related to COVID-19.\n“A total and complete sign off from White House Doctors yesterday. That means I can’t get it (immune), and can’t give it. Very nice to know,” Trump said in the tweet.\nThe post was flagged by Twitter with a disclaimer.\n“This Tweet violated the Twitter Rules about spreading misleading and potentially harmful information related to COVID-19,” Twitter’s disclaimer read, adding that it had determined that it may be in the public’s interest for the tweet to remain accessible.\nA Twitter spokeswoman told Reuters that the tweet made “misleading health claims” about COVID-19 and that engagements with the post would be “significantly limited,” as is standard in such cases.\nTrump said on Sunday he had fully recovered from COVID-19 and would not be a transmission risk to others, freeing him to return to holding big campaign rallies during the final weeks of the race for the White House.\nThe president first announced that he had had a positive coronavirus test on Oct. 2. Trump’s physician said on Saturday the president had taken a test showing he was no longer infectious.\nThe scientific evidence is unclear on how long people who have recovered from COVID-19 have antibodies and are protected from a second infection.\nTrump, who is trailing Democrat Joe Biden in opinion polls ahead of the Nov. 3 election, is eager to get back on the campaign trail after an absence of more than a week.\nHe plans to travel to the key battleground state of Florida on Monday, followed by rallies in Pennsylvania and Iowa on Tuesday and Wednesday, respectively.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18</td>\n<td>2020-10-11 19:52:00</td>\n<td>HEALTHCARE & PHARMA</td>\n<td>Germans must reduce travel, partying to fight COVID-19, says Merkel aide</td>\n<td>https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-germany/germans-must-reduce-travel-partying-to-fight-covid-19-says-merkel-aide-idUSKBN26W0T6</td>\n<td>FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Germany should continue capping the number of people allowed at gatherings and clamp down on unnecessary travel as the country battles rising coronavirus infections, an aide to Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Sunday.\n“We must be a bit stricter in places where infection chains spread mostly, which is parties and, unfortunately, also travel,” the chancellor’s chief of staff, Helge Braun, told public broadcaster ARD.\n“We are at the beginning of a second wave and only the politicians’ and the population’s determination will decide whether or not we can avoid it, or slow it down,” he added.\nGermany had managed to keep the number of new infections and deaths lower than many of its neighbours but the daily number of new cases has leapt above 4,000 since Thursday, the highest since April.\nSunday’s count was below that but that is because test reports tend to be lower at weekends.\nMerkel and mayors from Germany’s 11 largest cities agreed on Friday to adopt stricter measures if infections exceed a threshold of 50 cases per 100,000 population in a week.\nMore than 20 cities are now above that level, which has caused a patchwork of internal travel restrictions.\nBraun, a medical doctor, said test centres should prioritise health sector workers and people showing symptoms over tourists.\nHolidaymakers can circumvent the local travel curbs if they produce negative test results.\nBavaria’s prime minister, Markus Soeder, at the weekend proposed steeper fines for people not wearing masks where mandated in places such as public transport and shops -- of 250 euros ($295.60) compared with the current 50 euros, and 500 euros for repeat offenders.\nBraun said he agreed with tough penalties.\nMerkel will hold further talks with state premiers on Wednesday.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"
