Nagorno-Karabakh, which is internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan but populated and governed by ethnic Armenians, said its forces had repelled Azeri army attacks.\nThe ceasefire had already been badly frayed on Sunday, when Azerbaijan said it launched airstrikes against an Armenian regiment, following what it said was an Armenian rocket attack on a civilian apartment building.\nArmenia denied both Azeri assertions, and Reuters could not independently verify the reports.\nThe humanitarian ceasefire, which went into force on Saturday, was agreed at talks in Moscow to allow ethnic Armenian forces in Nagorno-Karabakh and the Azeri army to swap prisoners and bodies of people killed in fighting.\nThe talks were the first diplomatic contact between the two former Soviet republics since fighting over the mountain enclave broke out on Sept. 27. About 500 people have been reported killed since then.\nZohrab Mnatsakanyan, Armenia’s foreign Minister, was due to hold talks in Moscow later on Monday with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.\nAzerbaijan’s defence ministry said on Monday Armenian forces had tried repeatedly to attack its positions around the Aghdere-Aghdam and Fizuli-Jabrail regions, and were continuing to shell territories in the Goranboy, Terter and Aghdam regions insde Azerbaijan.\nAuthorities in Nagorno-Karabakh said their forces had inflicted losses on Azeri forces and that large-scale military operations were continuing in the Hadrut area of the tiny enclave.\nReuters could not independently verify the reports.\nThe conflict has raised fears of a wider war drawing in Turkey, an ally of Azerbaijan, and Russia, which has a defence pact with Armenia.\nThe renewed fighting is the worst since a 1994 ceasefire ended a war over Nagorno-Karabakh that killed at least 30,000. It has also raised concerns about the security of pipelines in Azerbaijan that carry Azeri natural gas and oil to Europe.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>2020-10-12 05:16:00</td>\n<td>EMERGING MARKETS</td>\n<td>EU leaders to insist on tough enforcement powers in Brexit deal: FT</td>\n<td>https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu/eu-leaders-to-insist-on-tough-enforcement-powers-in-brexit-deal-ft-idUSKBN26X09L</td>\n<td>(Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron and other EU leaders will insist on tough enforcement rules for any trade deal with Britain, warning that Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s bid to override the Brexit treaty has shown Britain’s word cannot be trusted, the Financial Times reported.\nEU diplomats said leaders at a summit starting on Thursday would call on EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier to ensure that \"level playing field\" guarantees for European businesses competing with British companies are backed by the right for Brussels to take rapid retaliatory action if Britain breaches its commitments, the FT reported on Monday. on.ft.com/34MuVHF\nFrance and other fishing nations in the EU will emphasise their determination to preserve quota rights in British waters, leaving Barnier with limited space to tease out a deal, the newspaper reported.\nThe EU wants to secure consistent rights to fish in British waters, an important issue for France where coastal fishing communities are politically influential.

The company stepped up investments in such technologies as it emerged in 2017 from the longest downturn in its history, as part of a plan to increase recurring revenue from lucrative sales of services.\nBut it’s early days, and such tech remains a niche part of Caterpillar’s operations. Though it does not break out the revenue from technology sales, the rising demand is unlikely to make a major impact anytime soon on the group’s revenue, which stood at about $54 billion last year.\nIt is also a costly endeavor with the company pumping billions into R&D as a whole. Yet it is not clear if demand for autonomous and remote tech will hold up in a post-pandemic world while, in the longer term, there is the risk that a technology-driven improvement in productivity could drive down sales of new equipment.\n‘IT HAS GOT CRAZIER’\nNonetheless, autonomous technology is helping Caterpillar win equipment deals from customers that were previously not buying a lot of its machines.\nLast year, Rio Tinto signed up the company to supply self-driving trucks, autonomous blast drills, loaders and other machines for the construction of the Koodaideri iron ore mine in Australia, which is expected to be operational next year.\nRio Tinto declined to comment on the equipment deal.\nThe mining industry has already adopted some technologies for self-driving trucks and remote operation of load-haul-dump machines. However the suspension in activities worldwide following government-mandated lockdowns at the peak of COVID-19, as well as recent outbreaks of infections at coal mines in Poland, have accelerated the deployment of those technologies.\nAnthony Cook, general manager for autonomous haulage systems at Caterpillar’s rival Komatsu, said a lot of customers had brought forward their spending plans following the pandemic in a bid to take drivers out of mining trucks.\nHe said the COVID-19 crisis had not hit the fortunes of his autonomous business: “If anything, it has got crazier.”\nCaterpillar and Komatsu hold the lion’s share of the global autonomous haulage system market worldwide.\nBut Illinois-based Caterpillar has a competitive advantage, according to some analysts, as its technology can be retrofitted onto competitors’ equipment, making it a better fit for mixed fleets. Komatsu’s technology currently only works with its own machines.\nKomatsu’s Cook said that while retrofitting offered a short-term solution, his company was developing technology to allow different brands of equipment to operate together “safely and efficiently”, which he added would offer long-term benefits.\nBut Jim Hawkins, general manager at Caterpillar’s resource industries division, said the ability to retrofit had helped drive up sales, because mining companies can buy the hardware and software to make machines operate autonomously without paying the much larger cost of overhauling their whole fleet.\nThat is a selling point at a time when miners are grappling with the virus-induced business uncertainty.\nCaterpillar sells autonomous operation technology separately from its machines. While retrofitting existing fleets has been the biggest driver for growth until now, Hawkins says an increasing number of customers are now ordering autonomous-ready mining trucks.\nThe company charges mining customers a hardware fee, a software fee and recurring licensing fee. In all, the technology could cost from $50 million to hundreds of millions of dollars, depending upon the size of the fleet and the duration of the contract, Hawkins said.\nAll these applications are part of the company’s endeavor to increases services revenue, which tends to be more resilient and profitable than equipment sales. It aims to increase services sales to $28 billion by 2026 from $18 billion in 2019.\nRob Wertheimer, machinery analyst at Melius Research, said the need for mining companies to replace an aging mining fleet and their growing demand for autonomous upgrades should help Caterpillar, with its tech giving it a “differential” advantage over rivals.\n“Strategically, they are in a better place,” he added.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>...</td>\n<td>...</td>\n<td>...</td>\n<td>...</td>\n<td>...</td>\n<td>...</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>38</td>\n<td>2020-10-12 06:41:00</td>\n<td>HEALTHCARE & PHARMACEUTICALS</td>\n<td>Asia-Pacific countries begin to ease pandemic-related travel bans, but hurdles remain</td>\n<td>https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-asia-travel/asia-pacific-countries-begin-to-ease-pandemic-related-travel-bans-but-hurdles-remain-idUSKBN26X0E6</td>\n<td>SYDNEY (Reuters) - Asia-Pacific countries including Singapore, Australia and Japan are gradually easing some international travel restrictions as coronavirus cases slow, in hopes of helping to revive their economies.\nInternational travel in Asia has collapsed during the pandemic due to border closures, with passenger numbers down 97% in August, according to the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines.\nAlthough European countries that had been more open add fresh travel restrictions as cases rise, in Asia the trend is toward easing, though not always on a bilateral basis.\nFor now, few people are likely to travel because of testing and insurance requirements, and in some cases the need to quarantine upon return home, meaning the deals offer limited hope for airlines and the tourism industry.\nA Singapore-Indonesia deal announced on Monday for essential business and official travel will require an application and COVID-19 swab tests both before and after travel.\nSingapore had established similar agreements with China, South Korea, Japan, Malaysia, and opened unilaterally to general visitors from New Zealand, Brunei, Vietnam and most of Australia.\nBut Singapore transport minister Ong Ye Kung said in parliament this month that the number of travellers remained small, with the country’s main airport serving 1.5% of its usual passenger volume.\nNew Zealanders will be able to travel to some parts of Australia starting Friday without quarantining, including to New South Wales, Canberra and the Northern Territory.\nHowever, New Zealanders who return from Australia must quarantine for two weeks under government supervision at the cost of NZ$3100 ($2,064.91) for the first person and more for additional family members.\nNew Zealand, due to hold an election on Oct. 17, has said it does not plan open its borders to Australians for now.\nAustralia is also in talks with Japan, South Korea, Singapore and South Pacific nations on reopening travel as coronavirus infections ease, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Sunday.\nJapan and Vietnam will allow short-term business travel with each other, the Yomiuri daily said on Saturday.\nThe pact, which will take effect by the end of October at the earliest, follows similar steps to ease business travel restrictions to Singapore and South Korea, the paper added.\nJapan is also planning to remove a ban on overseas travel to China and 11 other countries and regions including Taiwan, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea, Vietnam and Malaysia next month, the Yomiuri said, though it would still advise against non-essential travel.\nAsked about the report, immigration official Seiji Matano said that no decision had been made, but that the government would consider how to reopen traffic in a way that prevents infection.\nMany of the countries to which Japan will reportedly allow travel ban most non-citizens and non-residents from entering.\nJapan allows citizens, residents, and visa holders to reenter the country after testing negative for COVID-19 at the airport, with a capacity of about 10,000 per day.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>39</td>\n<td>2020-10-12 12:28:00</td>\n<td>RETAIL</td>\n<td>UK shopper numbers fall for third straight week: Springboard</td>\n<td>https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-retail-springboard/uk-shopper-numbers-fall-for-third-straight-week-springboard-idUSKBN26X1A7</td>\n<td>LONDON (Reuters) - Shopper numbers across British retail destinations fell marginally in the week to Oct. 10, the second complete week of the government imposed 10 pm closure of hospitality outlets, market researcher Springboard said on Monday.\nFootfall was down 0.3% versus the previous week.

We must prevent this from happening,” he said. “This is fundamentally about protecting Japan’s currency sovereignty.”\nYamamoto said he would prod the government and relevant agencies to speed up efforts to draft a revised BOJ law and other necessary legislation for issuing central bank digital currencies (CBDC).\nHowever, more broadly, Yamamoto has been a vocal advocate of making changes to the BOJ law, which sets out the central bank’s mandates.\nRevising the law to include digital currencies would also present a good opportunity to make other changes such as adding an inflation target and job creation to the mandates, much like the U.S. Federal Reserve, he added.\n“The new law should also clarify that 2% inflation is the BOJ’s policy target,” he told Reuters.\nThe BOJ does currently set 2% as its inflation target, introduced in 2013. But the target is not stipulated under the BOJ law, which says only that its role is to ensure Japan’s price moves and financial system are stable.\nCentral banks globally have been reviewing their strategic goals, with the European Central Bank widely expected to follow in the footsteps of the Fed in aiming for inflation of 2% on average, meaning that periods when prices grow too slowly can be compensated for with faster increases at another time.\n‘TOO LATE’\nCentral banks began looking closely at digital currencies after Facebook last year announced its yet-to-be-launched digital token Libra that would be backed by a mixture of major currencies and government debt.\nJapan has been cautious about moving too quickly on digital currencies given the social disruptions it could cause in a country that has the world’s most cash-loving population.\nBut China’s steady progress toward issuing digital currencies has prompted the government to reconsider, and pledge in this year’s policy platform to look more closely at the idea.\nOther major central banks have also accelerated studies on CBDCs, given the recent rapid innovation in financial technology.\nThe BOJ said on Friday it would begin experimenting in the next fiscal year on how to operate its own digital currency.\nYamamoto said the BOJ’s timeframe was “too late,” adding that the first phase of tests should begin during the current fiscal year to March 2021.\nCBDCs would also help regional banks, reeling from shrinking margins due to years of ultra-low interest rates, by allowing them to offer financial services at a lower cost and with less branches, Yamamoto added.\n“I don’t think we need to worry about any financial stability risks from issuing CBDCs,” he said.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>41</td>\n<td>2020-10-12 12:07:00</td>\n<td>BUSINESS NEWS</td>\n<td>New Apple 'iPhone 12' to offer 5G speeds U.S. networks can't deliver</td>\n<td>https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-iphone-5g-analysis/new-apple-iphone-12-to-offer-5g-speeds-u-s-networks-cant-deliver-idUSKBN26X18E</td>\n<td>(Reuters) - 5G will finally get its U.S. closeup with the expected debut of Apple Inc’s next iPhone on Tuesday. But the blazing speeds promised will not materialize for most people.\nThe device, dubbed the iPhone 12 by analysts, can tap into 5G, or fifth generation wireless technology, that theoretically operates as much as 10 to 20 times faster than current 4G wireless networks. [nL1N2H0004]\nUsing the next iPhone or any 5G enabled device on today’s network, however, will be “like having a Ferrari ... but using it in your local village and you can’t drive to up to 200 miles per hour, simply because the roads cannot maintain those speeds,” explained Boris Metodiev, associate director of research firm Strategy Analytics.\nApple, which is expected to unveil the new phone at a virtual event on Tuesday, will need to walk a tightrope between enticing consumers to upgrade their phones while not over-promising what 5G can do today.\nCurrent 5G U.S. networks mostly use low-band wireless spectrum, or airspace, that is slower than high-band spectrum, but more reliable over longer distances. It will likely take years before the massive speed boost phone carriers promise will make augmented reality and real-time cloud gaming seamless.\nSeveral U.S. telecom operators have deployed networks based on lower spectrum bands, with slightly higher speeds than 4G. A noticeably faster variant of “mid-band” 5G is also being rolled out, but it is unlikely to reach three-quarters of Americans until 2025, estimated longtime Apple analyst Gene Munster of venture capitalist firm Loup Ventures.\nThe fastest speeds touted by carriers are a type of 5G called millimeter Wave, or mmWave, that work over shorter distances. Verizon Communications Inc has the largest current mmWave network, available only in limited areas.\nAlthough Verizon 5G users could connect almost 10 times faster than on Sprint and T-Mobile, actual average speeds were far lower, according to research firm OpenSignal’s mobile signal experience report in June.\nOn average, AT&T Inc and Verizon customers with 5G phones saw only a small bump up from 4G speeds, according to the same study.\nIn South Korea and in China, faster 5G networks are more pervasive. But Apple will be competing against local brands including Samsung in South Korea, which is already on its second line of 5G phones, and China’s Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL], whose sales have surged after the telecom giant was banned in the United States.\nThe other big letdown is that applications using higher speeds to deliver something new have yet to be created. It is a chicken and egg problem at this part of the tech cycle, executives said, noting that interest in 4G was fueled by Facebook Inc’s mobile apps and Alphabet Inc’s YouTube.\n“The applications we will be dazzled by, that will really take advantage of the network, will only be developed once the network and devices are available,” said Morgan Kurk, chief technology officer of CommScope, a telecom equipment maker.\nU.S. consumers most motivated to buy a 5G phone would be those who need a new smartphone right now and are looking to protect their investments.\n“If you’re buying a phone that you’re going to have for three years, you’re going to want to make sure that it’s going to support the latest networks,” said Geoff Blaber, vice president of research at CCS Insight.\nJust know what to expect, Blaber added. “There’s going to be relatively little that you can do on a 5G iPhone you can’t do on a 4G iPhone today.”</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>42</td>\n<td>2020-10-12 12:18:00</td>\n<td>EMERGING MARKETS</td>\n<td>China Eastern Airlines to receive $4.6 billion capital injection</td>\n<td>https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-eastern-capital-injection/china-eastern-airlines-to-receive-4-6-billion-capital-injection-idUSKBN26X19L</td>\n<td>BEIJING (Reuters) - China Eastern Airlines 600115.SS will receive a cash injection of 31 billion yuan ($4.60 billion) from four new investors as part of an equity diversification plan, the company said on Monday.\nChina Life Investment Holding Limited, a subsidiary of the state-owned China Life Insurance Co 601628.SS, will inject 11 billion yuan into the airline, while Shanghai Jiushi Group, another state company, will inject 10 billion yuan, according to the public filing.\nChina Reform Holdings Corporation and China Tourism Group, both state-owned entities, will inject 5 billion yuan each.\nThe move is part of long-standing China’s efforts to diversify ownership structures among its state-owned enterprises and comes at a critical time after China Eastern posted a net loss of 8.5 billion yuan in the first half due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nChina Southern Airlines 600029.SS also announced last year that it would receive a capital injection of 30 billion yuan from three investors.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"
